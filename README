This is a basic shared expenses balance calculator.
It was made mainly as an exercise to get acquainted to enthought.traits API.

The typical usecase is: you go on holiday or week end with some good friends,
and you don't want to keep track of money all the time. Velat ("debts", in
finnish) will do it for you: just remember who paid for what, how much, and who
took part in what. At the very least you'll want to have only one big activity
(expense), and count everything in it.

And I prefer have a machine count for me.

the software
------------
This is a working lib, with simple GUI/other interfaces to be built around (a Qt4 Gui is almost done).
I think the heuristic is not perfect. And I saw it raise rounding issues... (assertionerrors)
